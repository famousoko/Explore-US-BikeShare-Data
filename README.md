# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

This project was completed is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python requirements.

## Overview

Using Python, explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States. 
Perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. 
write code to provide the following information:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Data Sources

In the data folder there are 3 files representing the wrangled data file for each city analyzed.
